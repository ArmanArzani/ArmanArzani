Hi there! My name is Arman Arzani and I am currently pursuing Computer Science.
I am passionate about programming and have experience with languages such as C++, Python, and Swift.
However, I am always open to learning new languages and improving my skills.
I am excited about collaborating with others and contributing to open-source projects.
Feel free to reach out to me through Armanarzaniwork@gmail.com to discuss any opportunities or just to say hello!
